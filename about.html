      <h1>About me</h1>

      <article class="blog-post">
        <h3 class="blog-post-title">Introduction</h3>
        <p>I am a telecommunication engineer with wide vagage as a backend developer and with knowledge of frontend development and systems administration.</p>
        <p>Recently adopting management roles as Product Owner and Product Manager, with skills in people management and product management with agile methodologies.</p>
        <p>Actually, as Product Manager, I prepare new features for development together with the agile team, following an MVP approach to launch improvements with each iteration. I try to build a clear and prioritized backlog, investing energy in making sure the agile rituals work productively and help create a great atmosphere and strong connection within my team. I present new developments to colleagues and stakeholders, including creative ways to teach the teams about the use and functionalities of new features. I inspire my team as much as stakeholders and make sure everybody is aware of the vision and roadmap. I try to create a strong feedback culture where everybody feels enabled to provide each other with honest feedback and input.</p>
        <p>I am the proud lead of a team that has created from scratch <a href="https://centribal.com" target="_blank">Centribal Plataform</a>, which is a product that aims to create and manage chatbots and connect them with the most popular instant messaging channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger but also to the most popular CRMs like <a href="https://zendesk.com" target="_blank">Zendesk</a> or <a href="https://salesforce.com" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>.</p>

        <h5>Product Manager @ <a href="https://centribal.com" target="_blank">Centribal</a></h5>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2018 - Actually</p>
        <p>At <a href="https://centribal.com" target="_blank">Centribal</a> as Product Manager I have to talk with clients, potential clients and stakeholders in order to collect requirements and analyze market needs to create a roadmap and well-prepared backlog. It’s very important to prioritize the product features and influence different teams of the company to ship successful products. This is possible by breaking down features in little tasks to be able to release them incrementally.</p>
        <p>At Centribal we work with the scrum framework using the Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira and Bitbucket) as a tool that helps us. I like to work as a servant leader to help my colleges grow up as much as they can. I consider myself as a team player.</p>
        <p>We have built Centribal Platform with the following technologies: Django with Python, React with JS, Ubuntu servers over AWS, MySQL databases like Aurora and RDS, monitoring and observability with Grafana and Prometheus and fast searching with Elasticsearch. The product is built from docker to production.</p>
        <p>I use to collaborate with the development team but also with operations and business roles in spanish and english fluently.</p> 
        <p>You can see the following Youtube videos making some demos of <a href="https://centribal.com" target="_blank">Centribal Platform</a>:
