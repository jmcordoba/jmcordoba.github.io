    <h3>Example table</h3>
    <p>And don't forget about tables in these posts:</p>
    <table class="table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Upvotes</th>
          <th>Downvotes</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Alice</td>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>11</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Bob</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Charlie</td>

      <tfoot>
        <tr>
          <td>Totals</td>
          <td>21</td>
          <td>23</td>
        </tr>
      </tfoot>
    </table>

    <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
