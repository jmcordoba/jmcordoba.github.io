 <p>When I started to work at <a href="https://centribal.com">Centribal</a> (called Bimyou in 2018) I searched for some books that helped me to start my new adventure. A book was recommended many times, it was (and is) <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/">The manager&rsquo;s path</a> writen by <a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille Fournier</a>.</p>
 <p><img src="https://www.juanmacordoba.com/images/books/managers_path_min.jpg" alt="Accelerate"></p>
 <p>It is a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ book again!</p>
